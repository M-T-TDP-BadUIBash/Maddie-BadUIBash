Do you ever feel like applying to a job is completely based on luck? That you could put anything you want in the "skills" field and it wouldn't matter because no human would ever read it? Boy do we have good news for you! Our company's application randomizes our question order and form inputs to add some fun to your job application process! And don't worry, even if a human were to read your resume, they wouldn't be able to understand it anyway, thanks to our Slot Machine Resume Uploader :)

Thanks to https://codepen.io/tangxuguo/pen/xqrNmx and https://codepen.io/simonfoust/pen/LzVEEZ for use of their slot machine assets.
